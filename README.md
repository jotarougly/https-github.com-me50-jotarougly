# Project 2 - Movie Browser
For this project, you'll be implementing a movie browser. It will allow users to
search for movies included in the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
and view additional information about any movies they select. Check out the
[staff solution](#staff-solution) for a working version.

## Requirements
- You may not import libraries other than the below:
  - `expo`
  - `react`
  - `react-native`
  - `prop-types`
  - `react-navigation`
  - Any library for icons
- There should be at least one `StackNavigator`
- There should be a search screen that allows users to search for movies
  - You should show more than 10 results if more than 10 results exist
- There should be a screen that shows additional information about a selected movie

The aesthetics of the app are up to you!

# My Quetions
I tried to divide the project by module but I get error when i want to render the navigation stack.
Error: The component for route 'Home' must be a React component. I tried to fix it but I do not get how to do.
If you can help me please.
Thanks you.
